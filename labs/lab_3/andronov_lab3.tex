	\item The source port is 54910 and the destination port is 80.\\
	\item The source is now 80 and the destination is 54910. \\
	\item The server is running Apache.\\	The HTML file the was requested was last modified on Tuesday, October 4th 	2016 at 17:17:01 GMT.\\
	\item There were a total of 9 GET messages sent. This could be either for reduancy, so that if packets are lost, at least one will make it through the network to bc.edu in order to initiate a respone, or part of some parallelization of certain process that each send their own HTTP GET message.
